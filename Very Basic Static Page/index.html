                    Kratos (Ancient Greek: Κράτος, lit.'strength') is a character and the protagonist of Santa Monica Studio's video game series God of War, which is based on Greek mythology and, later, Norse mythology. Kratos first appeared in the 2005 video game God of War, which led to the development of eight more titles featuring the character as the protagonist. Kratos also appears as the protagonist of the comic book series God of War in 2010 and 2018, and in three novels that retell the events of three of the games. The character was voiced by Terrence C. Carson from 2005 to 2013, and by Christopher Judge, who took over the role, in the 2018 continuation, which is also titled God of War. Antony Del Rio voiced young Kratos in Ghost of Sparta.
